                    <p>Local and session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They allow a website to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                        whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets
                        created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at
                        a time. Also local storage capacity is higher than session storage capacity.</p>

                    <p>Variables declared outside of any function become global variables. Global variables can be
                        accessed and modified from any function. On the other hand, a block scoped variable means that
                        the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can
                        reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block
                        even if the block is inside a function.</p>

                    <p>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                        asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
                        event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>
